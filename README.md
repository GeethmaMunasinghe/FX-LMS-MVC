# Learning Management System (LMS)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Learning Management System (LMS)** is a desktop-based application developed using **JavaFX** and **MySQL**, following the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architectural pattern. This project was built to demonstrate strong fundamentals in **object-oriented programming**, **desktop application development**, **database integration**, and **clean architectural design**, making it suitable for **entry-level software roles**.

## 🏗️ Architecture – MVC Pattern

The project strictly follows the **MVC architecture**:

* **Model**
  Contains the core business logic and database interaction logic. It represents entities such as Students, Teachers, Programs, Intakes, and Users.

* **View**
  Developed using **JavaFX and FXML**, responsible for the graphical user interface and user interactions.

* **Controller**
  Handles user actions, input validation, and communication between the View and the Model.

This architectural approach ensures:

* Clear separation of concerns
* Better maintainability and scalability
* Improved testability and code organization
